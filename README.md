# rus_grammar_explanations

These grammar explanations are published as Github Pages at `https://reynoldsnlp.github.io/rus_grammar_explanations/html/<lang>/<tag>.html`, replacing `<lang>` with `eng` or `nob`, and replacing `<tag>` with any of the error tags. The explanations are intended to be modular and standalone, with no assumed order.
